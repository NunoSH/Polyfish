# Polyfish
A repository to store methodologies to handle geospatial data of polyvalent fishing vessels using passive fishing gears. 

The current methodology  is intended to classify tracking data of polyvalent fishing vessels operating passive fishing gears. It allows to identify each passive fishing event, as long as deployment and hauling tracks overlap in space. Moreover, it allows to classify the tracking data as the start (deployment) and the end (hauling) of each fishing event. With that information, it is possible to calculate the soak time of each fishing event.
